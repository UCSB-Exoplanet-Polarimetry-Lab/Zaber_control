# Zaber_control

Repository directing how to control Zaber rotation stages. 
Built by Andy Zhou, with contributions by William Melby. 

Can download the **Zaber Launcher** [here](https://software.zaber.com/zaber-launcher/download). 
Can be used to assign distinct addresses to multiple devices, which allows for controlling them in series through a single computer connection (daisy-chaining). 

**Python** documentation can be found [here](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/tutorials/install/py)
